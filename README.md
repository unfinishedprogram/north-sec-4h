# 4H team shared repo

## Usage

Create `/personal/<your name>` and only directly push changes in this folder
This is to avoid having to resolve conflicts while keeping transparency between work

Each challenge should have it's own `/challenges/<challenge name>` folder.
All information and progress regarding the challenge should be only in that folder.
If you are working collaboratively on a challenge, please make a feature branch for it.

The logs are both present in the [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S3NzLCrH1SU_6MrMmKWnFmo03FF_PCEw2HkK5uWUq5w/edit?usp=sharing) and in the `logs` folder.
