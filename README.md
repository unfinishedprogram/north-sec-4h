# 4H team shared repo

## Usage

Create `/personal/<your name>` and only directly push changes in this folder
This is to avoid having to resolve conflicts while keeping transparency between work

Each challenge should have it's own `/challenges/<challenge name>` folder.
All information and progress regarding the challenge should be only in that folder.
If you are working collaboratively on a challenge, please make a feature branch for it.

The logs are both present in the [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S3NzLCrH1SU_6MrMmKWnFmo03FF_PCEw2HkK5uWUq5w/edit?usp=sharing) and in the `/personal/<your name>/logs` folder.

For the tasks management use the [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/hL4eu5Dg/ATTIfa62a0d578147e749c1db0da036dc1a29B8E69FB/nsec)

## VPN

You can use the `vpn-connect.sh` script to connect to the required vpn. Just make sure you have both the `ca.cert` and `team-008.vpn` files in the same directory as the script and to run it using `sudo`.
